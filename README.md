# SQL CHALLENGE

This project tasked me with using SQL queries to analyze various data for my new employer -- Pewlett Hackard. Through the use of basic Postgres queries, including joins, I manipulated data from six different tables to gain a better understanding of the organization's employee data from the 1980s and 90s.

### ERD Creation

Prior to beginning the analysis, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to understand the synergies amongst the various data tables provided by the organization. I used the online tool [Quick Database Diagrams](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to create the ERD, and provide a clearer picture of the organization.


### Requested Outputs

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
1. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
1. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
1. List the  department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
1. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
1. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
1. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
1. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
