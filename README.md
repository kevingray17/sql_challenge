# SQL CHALLENGE

This project allowed us to use SQL queries to analyze employee data for a specific organization. Through the use of basic Postgres queries, including joins, were able to pull content from six different tables to gain a better understanding of the organization's universe of associates.

#### Requested Outputs

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
1. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
1. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
